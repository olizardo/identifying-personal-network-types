# Introduction

## Aim of the study
- Can personal (ego) networks empirically classified using **structural** characteristics?
     - Diameter (Largest Connected Component)
     - Density
     - Modularity (Louvain)
     - Centralization (Betweenness)

## Previous Work: Bidart et al. (2018), *Social Networks*
- Supervised (Manual) Classification
- Younger Population
- French Context
- Their typology is meant to "produce structural measures of personal networks that are realistic and can be applied generally" (p. 2).

## Previous Work: Bidart et al. (2018), *Social Networks*
- Distinction between:
  - Attribute-based typologies
    - Role relation and demographic composition (e.g., kin/non-kin)
    - Support
  - Structural typologies
  - "Mixed" typologies
    - e.g., Gianella & Fischer (2016)

## Current Work
- Unsupervised (Clustering) Classification
- (Comparatively) Large Sample 
  - Most previous work relies on small samples (e.g., $N<100$)
- University Student Population
- U.S. Context

# Data and Approach

## Data
- NetHealth Study
     - Sample of 709 Members of the Class of 2019 at the University of Notre Dame
- Eight Ego Network Survey Waves over three years
     - Administered at beginning and end of each semester
     - Fall (August) 2015 - Spring (May) 2018
- Built Cumulative Ego Networks for Study Participant
- Total number of ego-alter dyads: 35,915 
     - Average of about fifty alters per ego

## Ego Network Survey Approach
- Online Qualtrics Survey
- Name Generator:
     - *List up to 20 people with whom you spend time
communicating or interacting*
- Name Interpreters:
     - Alter Sociodemographic characteristics (e.g., Gender, Race, Religion, etc.)
     - Relationship characteristics (e.g., Closeness, Role Relations, Duration, etc.)
- *Ego's report of whether two alters know one another*

## Analytic Sample
- Retain only participants with three or more alters
- Eliminated one participant who reported no connections between alters
- Listwise deletion of missing data
     - Number of egos: 700

# Results

## Cumulative Ego Network Size Distribution
![Y-Axis: Number of study participants; X- Axis: Ego-network size. Min = 3; Max = 153 ](plots/size-hist.png)

## Clustering Approach
- Tried a suite of methods
     - DBSCAN
     - Hierarchical DBSCAN
     - Latent Profile Analysis
     - k-means 
- Inspected relevant clustering quality metrics
     - k-means with four clusters produced best results

## Qualitative Summary of Cluster Analysis 
|Cluster           | Size | Diam. | Dens. | Mod. | Cent. |
| :---             | :--- | :---     | :---  | :--- | :---  |
|    1             |  +   |    +     |   --  |   +  |   +   |
|    2             |  +   |    +     |   --  |   +  |   --  |
|    3             |  +   |    +     |   --  |   -- |   +   |
|    4             |  --  |   --     |   +   |   -- |   --   |

## Qualitative Summary of Cluster Analysis (Bidart et al.'s Labels)
|Cluster           | Size | Diam. | Dens. | Mod. | Cent. |
| :---             | :--- | :---     | :---  | :--- | :---  |
|    Pearl Collar  |  +   |    +     |   --  |   +  |   +   |
|    Segmented     |  +   |    +     |   --  |   +  |   --  |
|    Centered Star |  +   |    +     |   --  |   -- |   +   |
|    (Small) Regular Dense |  --  |   --     |   +   |   -- |   --   |

- No evidence of a "centered dense" or a "dispersed" type 

## Clusters by Gender

## Clusters by Gender

## Clusters by Gender
- In this context:
  - Men:
    - Have smaller, denser, decentralized networks
  - Women: 
    - Have larger more segmented networks 
    - Centered on key intermediaries
    
## Clusters by Ethnoracial ID.

## Clusters by Ethnoracial ID.

## Clusters by Ethnoracial ID.
![](tabs/reg-tab-foreign.png)

## Clusters by Ethnoracial ID.
- In this context:
  - Relatively weak ethnoracial differences in personal network types
  - Foreign students:
    - More likely to have small, decentralized, dense networks
    

    

## Clusters by Socio-Economic Status

## Clusters by Socio-Economic Status

## Clusters by Socio-Economic Status

## Clusters by Socio-Economic Status
- Opposite of Bidart et al.'s (2018) results "...the social hierarchy corresponds to a contrast between the dense networks of the working classes and more fragmented networks of the upper classes" (p. 7).
    
- In the elite college context, we see segmented working class networks

- Income increases likelihood of having large, centralized networks, up to a point

# Conclusion
## To Do List
- Ascertain Role Relations and Tie Characteristics of Central Alters
- Move to a decision tree approach
  - To empirically estimate estimate cutoff values for structural features
  - Select number of clusters best predicted by DT
- Enhance clustering with other structural features
  - Number of Components
  - Proportion of alters in largest component
  - Others?
