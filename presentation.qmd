## Aim of the study
- Can personal (ego) networks empirically classified using **structural** characteristics?
     - Diameter (Largest Connected Component)
     - Density
     - Modularity
     - Betweenness Centralization

## Previous Work
- Bidart et al. (2018), *Social Networks*
- Supervised (Manual) Classification
- Younger Population
- French Context

## Current Work
- Unsupervised (Clustering) Classification
- More Expansive Data
- Older (University Student) Population
- U.S. Context

## Data
- NetHealth Study
     - Sample of 709 Members of the Class of 2019 at the University of Notre Dame
- Eight Ego Network Survey Waves over three years
     - Administered at beginning and end of each semester
     - Fall (August) 2015 - Spring (May) 2018
- Construct Cumulative Ego Networks for Study Participant
- Total number of ego-alter dyads: 35,915 
     - Average of about fifty alters per ego

## Ego Network Survey Approach
- Online Qualtrics Survey
- Name Generator:
     - *List up to 20 people with whom you spend time
communicating or interacting*
- Name Interpreters:
     - Alter Sociodemographic characteristics (e.g., Gender, Race, Religion, etc.)
     - Relationship characteristics (e.g., Closeness, Role Relations, Duration, etc.)
- *Ego's report of whether two alters know one another*

## Analytic Sample
- Retain only participants with three or more alters
- Eliminated one participant who reported no connections between alters
     - Number of egos: 707
     
## Cumulative Ego Network Size Distribution

## Clustering Approach
- Tried a suite of methods
     - DBSCAN
     - Hierarchical DBSCAN
     - Latent Profile Analysis
     - k-means 
- Inspected relevant clustering quality metrics
     - k-means with four clusters produced best results
